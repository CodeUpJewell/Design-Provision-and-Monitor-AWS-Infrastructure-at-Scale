Notice								
*With the reduction in our budget (by 2000.00 USD) we have to cut back on our DB instance from a db.m5.4xlarge(vCPU: 16, Memory: 64 GIB), to a db.m5.2xlarge(vCPU: 8, Memory: 32 GIB). We've also have made a slight reduction in the total data processed per ALB for our EC2 Instances and IP addresses as targets per hour, from 5 to 4 GB per hour.
