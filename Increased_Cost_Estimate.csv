With the substantial increase in our budget, we've decided to increase our DB storage capacity to 300GB, aswell as increase our DB Instance type to (db.m5.8xlarge) from DB Instance type (db.m5.4xlarge) to handle an increase in capability to handle bigger server load.  								
We've also increased our capacity on our s3 storage both inbound and outbound. Our web servers and application servers have seen a sizeable increases from m5.4xlarge and m5a.large, to a m5.8xlarge and m5a.4xlarge. This will allow us to handle a larger traffic size.								
Our CloudFront capacity has been doubled and our ELB has been adjusted to handle an increase in connections.
